Key GitHub Features Explained
Commits:
A commit is a saved change to your project. Each commit includes a message describing what was changed.
Branches:

Pull Requests:
A pull request is a way to propose changes from one branch to another. It’s how collaboration happens — you review, discuss, and merge changes.
