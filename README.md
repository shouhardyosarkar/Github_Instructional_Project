# What Is GitHub and Why Is It Useful?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help individuals and teams manage code and collaborate on projects. It’s widely used in software development, but also valuable for documentation, design, and data projects.

# Key GitHub Features Explained

Commits:

A commit is a saved change to your project. Each commit includes a message describing what was changed.

Branches:

A branch is a separate version of your project. You can experiment or develop features without affecting the main code.

Pull Requests:

A pull request is a way to propose changes from one branch to another. It’s how collaboration happens — you review, discuss, and merge changes.
